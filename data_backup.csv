1,Deep Learning with Python,https://images.manning.com/360/480/resize/book/7/65fca1c-6826-472d-bbea-c1d4a7b3c570/Chollet-DLP-HI.png,Machine Learning with TensorFlow gives readers a solid foundation in machine-learning concepts plus hands-on experience coding TensorFlow with Python. You'll learn the basics by working with classic prediction, classification, and clustering algorithms. Then, you'll move on to the money chapters: exploration of deep-learning concepts like autoencoders, recurrent neural networks, and reinforcement learning. Digest this book and you will be ready to use TensorFlow for machine-learning and deep-learning applications of your own.,5,https://www.manning.com/books/deep-learning-with-python,['Got me an A.']
2,Machine Learning with TensorFlow,https://images.manning.com/360/480/resize/book/d/848f767-1c05-470a-83f4-9ddabb67fdbd/Shukla-MLTF-HI.png,Deep Learning with Python introduces the field of deep learning using the Python language and the powerful Keras library. Written by Keras creator and Google AI researcher Fran√ßois Chollet, this book builds your understanding through intuitive explanations and practical examples. You'll explore challenging concepts and practice with applications in computer vision, natural-language processing, and generative models. By the time you finish, you'll have the knowledge and hands-on skills to apply deep learning in your own projects.,4,https://www.manning.com/books/machine-learning-with-tensorflow,"['Got me an B. The TensorFlow version used in this book is convoluted and weird. I am hoping to see a second edition of this book based on the newest / better version of TF.']
3,Classic Computer Science Problems in Python,https://images.manning.com/360/480/resize/book/9/d4b47c9-453f-4ab7-a20f-cfd0836aa74e/Kopec-CCSPP-HI.png,"Classic Computer Science Problems in Python deepens your knowledge of problem solving techniques from the realm of computer science by challenging you with time-tested scenarios, exercises, and algorithms. As you work through examples in search, clustering, graphs, and more, you'll remember important things you've forgotten and discover classic solutions to your ""new"" problems!",3,https://www.manning.com/books/classic-computer-science-problems-in-python,['Good book but it is intended for programmers who want to become proficient in Python. It is not very relevant for AI or apps written with other languages and frameworks.']
